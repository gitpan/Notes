      #             (the shorter to type the more often used) with
      #             reasonable _default_ behaviour for poor Notes admins
      #         (b) _always_ returning at least one entry object that
      #             allows further clever methods to be applied;
      #             investigate what happens when in $a->b(...)->c(...)
      #             $a->b(...) returns a list of suitable objects
      #             for method c(...); Does c() get called with the
      #             return list of b(...) provided the first list elem
      #             is of correct type ? What about c( b( $a ) ???
      #         (c) removing the add_entry(_with_no_access) methods,
      #             as those are hardly needed, cause remove_entry
      #             is mostly more appropriate in that situation
      #         (d) morphing the methods into Perlish ones, i.e. make
      #             them accept a variable number of arguments, e.g.
      #             add_all_entries_and_full_manager_access(a,name,...)
      #         (e) change the name of the "full_control"-methods to
      #             e.g. add_entry_with_full_manager_access
      #             as those are hardly needed            
      #  
      #
